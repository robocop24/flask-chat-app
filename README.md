-> Building your Chat Application using Flask in few minutes.
-> Prerequisites for this are few concepts bound with Flask, SocketIO and jquery.
-> These three form the bedrock in building one such chat app.

-> Flask : It’s one of the robust frameworks which is known for its simplicity,
          flexibility and several add ons which can later be included if the user wishes to do so.
-> install flask:
        $ pip install flask

-> SocketIO :-SocketIO is a cross-browser Javascript library that abstracts the client application from 
              the actual transport protocol.
             -There’s an extension known as ‘flask-socketio’ which enables us to do.
             -Flask-SocketIO gives flask applications access to bi-directional communications between
              the clients and the server.
-> install flask-socketio:
        $ pip install flask-socketio

-> Run the application using the command: python main.py

-> To run the chat application, open your web browser and hit the URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
